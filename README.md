README

MOTIVATION: When taking certain courses at UCSD, this would have saved me so much time! Similarly, I
wanted to explore shell programming a little more and have more hands on practice.

PURPOSE: Feel free to use these scripting projects to generate headers for single or multiple files, 
sort the size of files in a given directory (compare file sizes in a neat, readable format), and compare 
numeric quantities of a symbol or sequence of characters between two files. For instance, if you want to 
compare the number of ">" in the solution's output vs your output (contains specific details as well).
